# Lenstra

This is a very simple python program that attempts to find if a number is not prime using the [Lenstra elliptic-curve factorization](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lenstra_elliptic-curve_factorization) algorithm.
Using Lenstra helps this program purpose: determining if a number is not prime by finding small factors in large composite numbers.

## Usage
Run the program with the required arguments:

```bash
python lenstra.py -n <number> [-i <iterations>] [-v] [-b <base>]
```

### Arguments:
- `-n, --number` (required): The number to test.
- `-i, --iterations` (optional, default=100): The maximum number of iterations for the algorithm.
- `-b, --base` (optional, default=10): Base of the number to test (binary=bin, octal=oct, decimal=dec, hexadecimal=hex)
- `-v, --verbose` (optional): Enables extra logging for debugging and detailed output.

### Example:
```shell
python lenstra.py -n 0x4DEDD4133315C883 -i 200 -v -b hex
```
This will attempt to find factors of `5615377489327409283` (4DEDD4133315C883 in hexadecimal) using up to `200` iterations with verbose logging enabled. Note that you can also write the hexadecimal digits in lowercase.

> [!IMPORTANT]  
> The Lenstra algorithm is probabilistic and may not always find factors within the given iteration limit.
> For large numbers, increasing the iteration count may improve the chance of finding factors.

## Requirements
This program does not require external packages as dependencies.
